## Branches

* Master — major releases, main branch
* Develop — current development branch (make your pull requests here)


## Why

Tired of typing `db.users.findOne({_id:ObjectId(...)})` just to look up data structure. Even more typing to modify the data. Can't find Node.js implementaton (not true any more, there is [exprss-mongo](https://github.com/andzdroid/mongo-express)).


# Use

To start the server run:

  $ node .

or:

  $ node index.js

# Chrome extension

Download and install [JSONView Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) to view JSON in a human readable format.
